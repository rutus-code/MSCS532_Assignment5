### Project Overview
This project consists of three Python scripts:

1. *quickSort.py:* Implements the Quick Sort algorithm, a comparison-based sorting technique that uses a binary heap data structure.

2. *randomizedQuickSort.py:* Implementation of randomized quick sort algorithm
3. **empiricalAnalysis.py**: Implementation of Empirical Analysis between Randomized and Quick sort algorithms using matplotlib.pyplot
